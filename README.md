# 🎶 SelfMusicBot
A music bot designed to be hosted on normal Discord accounts
## ⚠ USING THIS IS AGAINST DISCORD'S TOS AND MAY GET YOUR ACCOUNT BANNED

# 🔧 How to setup
Check the wiki page of the proper bot [here](https://github.com/vlOd2/PYMusicBot/wiki/Setup) for a guide on setup (but use your account's token instead of a bot one. An alt is recommended)

# ❓ But why?
This self-bot was made as a test, for [Omniarchive](https://omniarchive.uk) due to them lacking a proper music bot.<br>
But now it is a proper music self-bot
